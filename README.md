Defense Evasion Techniques Repository

Welcome to the Defense Evasion Techniques Repository! This repository contains a collection of techniques designed to bypass Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) systems. These techniques include:

| Technique           | Description                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Syscalls            | Exploring ways to manipulate system calls to evade detection.   |
| API Hashing         | Techniques for obfuscating and altering API calls to avoid detection.   |
| Obfuscation         | Methods to obfuscate code and make it harder to analyze.   |
| Direct and Indirect Calls | Strategies for making direct and indirect function calls to evade detection mechanisms.   |
